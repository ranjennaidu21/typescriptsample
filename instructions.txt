1) npm install typescript@2.4.2

2) create directory and add mainjs.ts file

3) now add some javascript code and perform this code in the directory to compile ts code into javascript code that can read y
browser
>tsc mainjs.ts

4) once compile you can see main.js file generated
all javascript code is also a valid typscript code. 

5) you dont have to manually do this in angular. when do ng serve , 
angular automatically compile all typscript code into javascript code

6) now we can try to run the javascript code using node command:
> node mainjs.js , can see the console.log printed in vs console.

7) the typescript will still compile to javascript es5 even have compilation issues.
refer maints.ts

8) we can combile multiple commands
tsc main.ts && node main.js
